# Glossary
 This is a glossary of terms associated with the design, manufacture, assembly, and test of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and assemblies. The terms in **BOLD** are terms you should look up and become fluent with since they will come up frequently during discussions related to PCBs.

 Please let us know if you have a better definition than the one you see here so we can improve the Glossary.

 <details>
    <summary>Annotation</summary>

    noun - the information added to a design that makes refering to things easier
            "I added the Q1 annotation."
    verb - the act of adding information (such as reference designators) to a design
           This can be done via automation or manually. It is often possible to add annotation to either the schematic or the board layout.
           "We annotated all components again to make things sequential."

    <summary>Ball Bonding</summary>

> The most common type of wire bonding used to make an electrical connection between a chip and another component on a semiconductor device. A very thin wire (typically a dozen micrometers thick and made of gold or copper) is fed through a capillary tube and brought close to the surface of the chip that needs to be connected. A high-voltage electric charge is applied to the wire to melt its tip. When the wire melts, it forms a ball due to surface tension of the metal. The addition of heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy cause the ball to weld to the chip. (Image source: Wikipedia)

Its advantages include having high density, meaning it can be used with ICs with hundreds of pins, having good heat conduction because the grid array allows better heat flow betwen the IC and the PCB, and having lower inductance because the connection between the IC and PCB is very short.

    <summary>Thieving</summary>

> Copper (often in the form of dots, grid, or solid fill) added to the outer layer of a PCB to ensure a uniform distribution of copper plating on the features of the PCB. The "thieving steals" plating current from concentrating on sparse features and instead spreads it out over areas with many features. This also reduces the amount of copper that needs to be etched away, leading to more even etching times across the board. It's also used to even out the thermal properties of a board to prevent twist and warp during the thermal cycling that occurs in the reflow process.

> A continuous path of copper used to make electrical connections on a PCB. As shown in the image below, the trace is the area between the two dark lines coming out of the RES pin and 5V pins. Traces vary in width depending on what current they are carrying. In this case, the RES pin has a narrower trace than the 5V trace. (Image source: Sparkfun)

    <summary>Transmission Line</summary>

> A set of conductors that connects a signal between its source and destination. There are three common types of transmission lines: microstrips (left), striplines (middle), or coplanar waveguides (right). For each type, we can calculate the characteristic impedance and electrical length to analyze circuit performance. Each type is defined by their specific geometry and consequently their electrical coupling. Microstrips are signal traces which have a dielectric layer beneath them (and ideally a ground plane beneath the dielectric) and have their top side exposed to air. Microstrips are used on the top and bottom sides of a PCB. Striplines are like microstrips, but have a dielectric layer above and below the trace (and ideally a ground plane above the top dielectric and one below the bottom dielectric). Striplines are used in the inner layers of a PCB. Coplanar waveguides are like microstrips, but ground traces run parallel to the signal trace. The ground traces provide the signal trace with better coupling. Coplanar waveguides can appear on the top and bottom of PCBs.

    <summary>Ultrasonic Bonding</summary>
 
> A process in which two workpieces are bonded by the pressure of high-frequency ultrasonic sound waves. Generally used for thermoplastics and thin metals. For electronics, ultrasonic welding can be used to make small electrical connections (ex. wire bonding). PROOFREAD

    <summary>Via(s)</summary>

> A hole in a PCB that allows current to pass from one layer to another. Vias can either be tented, meaning that they are covered by the soldermask so nothing can be soldered to them, or untented, meaning that we can solder a component to it.

    <summary>Via Stitching</summary>

> A PCB design technique to tie together large copper areas. Stitching vias can be used to join ground planes on different layers to lower return path impedance. Stitching vias are important in RF design; they can be placed around an RF trace to EM interference with other components on the board. PROOFREAD AND TODO (b/c i don't actually understand)

    <summary>V-Scoring</summary>

> A method of cutting a V-shaped groove into PCBs to split them. This is useful when you want to leave a set of PCBs grouped for easier assembly but want to separate them afterwards. Alternative to mouse bites.

    <summary>Wire Bonding</summary>

> A method to make an electric connection between an integrated circuit and chips. Different types of wire bonding include ball bonding and wedge bonding. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazeH4PHvpk) that shows both methods of wire bonding.

 <details>
    <summary>Wedge Bonding</summary>

> Unlike ball bonding, wedge bonding requires the wire to be in a specific direction during bonding, so it's a slower process than ball bonding due to the extra time needed for tool alignment. However, the lack of the ball means wedge bonds can be used in finer pitch applications (PROOFREAD). Wedge bonding can use a larger diameter wire than ball bonding.
