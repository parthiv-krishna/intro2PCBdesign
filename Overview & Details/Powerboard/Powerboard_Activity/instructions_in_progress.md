### Powerboard Activity 

#### Step 1: Create a .kicad_pcb file to layout the board 

* Open up the project file (.pro) and select the "PCB Layout Editor" button. KiCAD will ask you to confirm that you want to create a new .kicad_pcb file.

#### Step 2: Change the board to be a **four layer** board. 

By convention, when referring to the number of layers in a PCB, we refer to the number of copper layers. 
* Go to "File" -> "Board Setup" 
* Set the number of "Copper Layers" to 4
